# Conversational-Chatbot-Using-Deep-learning
This is a deep learning project where I have created a conversational Chatbot using movie scripts of 600 movies as my dataset. 
The ChatBot is built with the help of Seq2Seq model and RNN's are used for encoding and decoding the questions and answers.

One of the main advantages of Chatbot is that it is highly scalable and can be used as the first level of communication for client servicing.

The dataset used for training the ChatBot is the Cornell-Movie-Corpus data. The link for the dataset is given below:
